# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) Demo

This is a demo of the Interface Segregation Principle in C#, using musical instruments as an example. The principle states that no client should be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead, we can create more specific interfaces for each type of instrument.

The `main` branch contains a single interface which violates the principle. Switch to the `demo` branch to see how it could be refactored according to the ISP.
